Create a pull request for ticket: $ARGUMENTS

Run this only because the user asked for it. Pushing is outward-facing.

## Steps
1. Check the branch is not `main` and the working tree is clean (`git status`). If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user.
2. Run `/verify --build`. If any exit code is not 0, stop. Do not open the PR.
3. Run `/security-scan`. Stop on High findings.
4. Read the ticket: `gh issue view <number> --repo vohungbk/xiangqi-arena`. Copy every AC row verbatim.
5. Load the `pr-description` skill and fill `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:
   - `Closes #<number>`
   - AC table with status (Pass / Fail / Block / Skip / Not run) and real evidence
   - Impact assessment from the actual diff (`git diff main...HEAD`)
   - Verification checklist: tick only what was run
   - Do not tick "passes in CI" yet
6. Push and create the PR:
   - `git push -u origin <branch>` (never force push)
   - `gh pr create --base main --title "<conventional title>" --body-file <file>`
7. Bind the PR with the ccd_pr tools if available. Report the PR link.

## Rules
- Base branch is `main`.
- Title uses Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
- Never enable auto-merge. Never merge the PR.
- No secrets, `.env` or build output in the diff.
